This is a bookmark manager project using basic html,css and js.The UI might not look that good but it functions as a functional bookmark.The local storage part was done by chatgpt because it was bit advanced as it uses json.Rest was done by me.I learnt from codewithHarry sigma web dev course and implemented the concepts in this project.In order to use this product download all three files.Then launch HTML file.You are good to go.Ensure that all three files are stored in same folder else the application won't work
